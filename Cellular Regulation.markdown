[^DoubleTest]: Note that this is the same day as, and probably directly after, the second BIOL 243 test.

Course objectives:

> A student who has passed this course will be able to describe (demonstrate) how: 

> 1. Proteins are targeted to different destinations within cells
> 2. Proteomics can be used to study cellular processes
> 3. The cell cycle and apoptosis are regulated
> 4. Signal transduction occurs within cells 
> 5. Able to conduct experiments and analyse data relevant to cell biologists
> 6. Work in small groups

Course requirements:

* An overall pass grade of 50%
* A mark of 45% or more in _each_ section, including exam sections, in-term tests, individual lab sections _etc_.

## Signal Transduction

### Introduction

Multiple methods, including:

* Phosphorylation
* Protein kinases A &amp; C
* Trimeric G-proteins
* MAP kinases
    * Mechanism of getting signals from surface of the cell to nucleus
* Tyrosine kinases
* Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling
* Wnt signalling

We'll also talk about:

* Signalling domains
* Scaffolding and anchoring
* STATS transcription factors
* Nuclear receptors

We'll emphasise mechanisms, techniques, specificity, and consequences.

#### Regulating cellular activity

Regulation between cells:

* Small organic molecules
* Small inorganic molecules
* Peptides
* Extracellular vesicles

Regulation within cells:

* Second messengers
* Covalent modification
    * Phosphorylation
	* Often associated with on/off changes in activity, including by location changes, and recruiting other proteins (allowing binding)
	* Competing phosphatases and kinases allow rapid response
	* Serine, Threonine, Tyrosine
    * Prenylation
    * Fatty acids
    * Proteolysis (cutting up)
    * Glycosylation (sugars)
    * Adenylation (AMP)
* Cellular distribution

### Techniques for studying signal transduction

To detect phosphorylation in cellular systems or isolated proteins we can use immunological detection (antibodies&mdash;western blot), phosphoprotein stains, and labelled ATP or phosphate. Mass spectrometry will tell you protein abundance and phosphorylation state, but not the location of the protein in the tissue or cell.

If looking at protein in a rat brain:

* Take out brain
* Slice up
* Use primary antibody to attach to target protein
* Use secondary antibody to attach to primary antibody&mdash;fluorescently label
* Inspect with microscope to see location
