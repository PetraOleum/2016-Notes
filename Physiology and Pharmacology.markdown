Description:

> The major emphasis in this paper will be the correlation of molecular and cellular mechanisms with physiological functions in humans and other mammalian species. An integrative approach will be adopted in studying the roles of the central and peripheral nervous system and various organ systems in relation to the metabolic, hormonal and homeostatic mechanisms involved in circulation, respiration, and digestion. Neurophysiology and renal excretion will be covered at 300-level in BMSC 335. The modulation of physiological function will be explored in a series of pharmacology lectures. These will focus on the mediation of such effects at the molecular level.
