Description:

> The major emphasis in this paper will be the correlation of molecular and cellular mechanisms with physiological functions in humans and other mammalian species. An integrative approach will be adopted in studying the roles of the central and peripheral nervous system and various organ systems in relation to the metabolic, hormonal and homeostatic mechanisms involved in circulation, respiration, and digestion. Neurophysiology and renal excretion will be covered at 300-level in BMSC 335. The modulation of physiological function will be explored in a series of pharmacology lectures. These will focus on the mediation of such effects at the molecular level.

## Physiology

The first part, with Dr Miller, starting July 11.

### The Autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls bodily processes that are not consciously controlled, e.g. breathing, digestion etc. The ANS is divided into the Sympathetic (SNS) and Parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous systems, which broadly act as opposites.

Controls e.g.

* Heart rate
* Blood pressure
* Intestinal mobility
* Perspiration

You can teach yourself to control _some_ of the autonomic functions, but not all of them.

#### Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)

* "Excitable", like when being chased or scared
* Ganglia lie near spinal cord
* Accelerates
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Brake for
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Drugs that block the effect of noradrenalin and adrenalin 
    * Synthesis and storage
        * Reserpine
    * Release from the nerve terminal
        * Guanethidine
    * Alpha blockers
        * Phentolamine
        * Phenoxybenzamine
    * Beta blockers
        * beta<sub>1</sub> and beta<sub>2</sub>: propranolol
        * beta<sub>1</sub> only: metoprolol
        * beta<sub>2</sub> only: albuterol
    * Ganglionic blockers
        * Hexamethonium
        * Suxamethonium

* Ganglia lie in/near effector organ
* Accelerates
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Brake for
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Parasympathomimetic drugs (mimic effect of stimulated PSNS
    * Nicotine (activates nicotine receptors)
    * Pilocarpine and methacholine
        * Activate muscuranic receptors
        * Cause e.g. profuse sweating
* Cholinesterase inhibitors
    * Neostigmine
    * Physostigmine (eserine)
    * Potentiate the effect of acetylcholine
* Antimuscarinic drugs
    * Atropine (belladonna)
    * Scopolamine
    * Block the effect of acetylocolin on effector cells
    * Cause pupillary dilation

### Cardiovascular system

The cardiovascular system is made of two circuits: systemic and pulmonary

The left heart pumps blood to all the tissues&mdash;systemic system&mdash;and is therefore much more muscular. The right heart is floppier, because it only has to pump to the heart.

In the systemic system the capillaries are in parallel, not in series. The portal circuits allow blood to go from the gut to the liver.

The systemic system has a much higher pressure than the pulmonary system. Further, the arteries of the systemic system are higher pressure than the veins. Arteries are more muscular, have a redder colour, and pulse more than veins.

#### Heart anatomy

Four chambers: Left and right ventricles and atrium. Right atrium takes blood from veins of systemic system,[^venacava] and right ventricle pumps into pulmonary artery. The left atrium takes oxygenated blood from pulmonary veins[^pluveins] and the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta and thus systemic arteries. Valves control flow between atria and ventricles, regulated by pressure. When the pressure in the ventricle is lower than the pressure in the atrium, AV valves are opened. When the pressure in the aorta is lower than the pressure in the ventricle, the aortic valves are opened. The _chordae tendineae_, pulled by the papillary muscles, move the AV valve.

[^venacava]: Specifically, the superior and inferior _vena cava_. The superior comes from above, inferior below.

[^pluveins]: There are multiple pulmonary veins which drain directly into the left ventricle.

#### Heart rate

The hummingbird's heart beats, when exercising, at 1200 bpm, or 20 bps. As a general rule, larger animals have slower heartbeats. Whales do 10-15 bpm; humans around 70 bpm. It is theorised that the pacemaker in the SA node can beat 10<sup>9</sup> times in a lifetime, but this is too few for an average lifespan.

Heart cells in culture beat independently and spontaneously, but when multiple cells are put together they beat synchronously. The fastest cell (highest bpm) acts as a pacemaker. In the heart the SA node has the fastest automaticity, so is the pacemaker. The AV node is the second fastest, so when there are problems with the SA node it takes over&mdash;however, this is slower and less regular. In disease, the ectopic focus can take over as pacemaker.

In some animals&mdash;crustaceans, insects, annelids&mdash;the heart beat is neurogenic, and so removing the heart will cause it to cease to beat. Vertebrate, tunicates, and molluscs have myogenic heart beats. A human heart would not beat for very long, however, because it would run out of oxygen very quickly; a frog heart would beat for much longer.

Internodal atrial pathways radiate out from the SA node and into the atria. One of these reaches the AV node in the centre of the heart; this is the only way for current to cross a "non-conductile" fibrous tissue ring that separates the atria and ventricles. Right and left bundle branches come down from the AV node to the base of the heart, then radiate out from below into the ventricles through the Purkinje fibres. This allows the atria and the ventricles to contract one after the other.

#### Cardiac action potentials

An individual heart fast response fibre cell first spikes, plateaus, and then reverts to normal. The refractory period is between 200 and 250 msec. The tension follows a different graph, trailing the action potential.

Slow response fibres have a different pattern, with spontaneous depolarisations due to an Na<sup>2+</sup> leak.

#### Cardiac electrical pathologies

A normal ECG has P, QRS, and T waves. The T wave is a repolarisation wave; while another repolarisation wave for the atria is concealed under the QRS wave.

A ECG with "bipolar leads" means that the ECG is recorded from two electrodes on the body.

* Lead I: left arm + right arm
* Lead II: left leg + right arm
* Lead III: left leg + leg arm

Third lead is earth (ground).

The Mean Electrical Axis is the mean vector through the partially depolarised heart. The average mean electrical axis is 59&deg; down, but the normal range is +110&deg; to -30&deg;. This will be calculated in lab 3, human circulation. Only two leads are needed to calculate the vector, however if you use all three you can work out how consistent your measurements are.

The normal off-balance of the axis is due to the normal asymmetry of the heart, and so this can be used to diagnose diseases related to non-normal asymmetry. For example, hypertrophy of the left ventricle can be seen in a large left shift of the axis. Hypertrophy can be caused by the heart having to work a lot harder, whether due to exercise or through a variety of underlying pathologies.

Left axis shift can also be called by a left bundle branch block, which slows the passage of current to the left and makes it pulse later.

Right axis shift can be caused by hypertrophy of the right ventricle, pulmonary valve stenosis, or interventricle septal defect.

#### Cardiac Arrhythmias

This can be caused by:

* Abnormal rhythmity of the pacemaker
* Shift of pacemaker from sinoatrial node
* Blocks at different points in the transmission of the cardiac impulse
* Abnormal pathways of the transmission in the heart
* Spontaneous generation of abnormal impulses (ectopic beats) from any parts of the heart

Normal arrhythmias:

* Bradycardia
    * A slow heart rate usually less than 60 bpm
    * Present in athletes who have a large stroke volume
    * Can be caused by vagal stimulation
* Tachycardia
    * Fast heart rate, usually greater than 100 bpm
    * Caused by:
        * Increased body temperature
        * Sympathetic stimulation (e.g. loss of blood or reflex stimulation of the heart)
        * Emotion
        * Toxic conditions of the heart
        * Exercise
    * E.g. Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

Abnormal arrhythmias:

* Atrial Paroxysmal Tachycardia
    * "Paroxysmal" = A series of rapid heart beats that suddenly start and then suddenly stop
    * Can be stopped with a vagal reflex or quinidine or procainimide
    * P waves is inverted if origin is near AV node
    * Occurs by re-entrant pathways
* Ventricular Paroxysmal Tachycardia
    * Usually does not occur unless there has been ischemic damage
    * Quinidine increases refractory period of cardiac muscle and can eliminate the problem
* Extra beats (ectopic foci)
    * Often near nodal tissue
    * Premature contractions
    * Caused by
        * Local areas of ischemia
        * Calcified plaques
        * Toxic irritation of AV node, Purkinje system, or myocardium by drugs (nicotine, caffeine)
* SA block
    * Rare
    * Impulses from the SA node are blocked
    * Causes cessation of p waves
    * New pacemaker&mdash;usually AV node (next fastest rate)
* AV block
    * May be due to fibrosis of conductile tissue
    * Impulses through AV node and bundle are slowed or blocked due to
        * Ischemia of AV nodal or AV bundle fibres (can be caused by coronary ischemia)
        * Compression of AV bundle (by scar tissue or calcified tissue)
        * AV nodal or AV bundle inflammation
        * Excessive vagal stimulation
    * First degree heart block
        * Prolonged PR interval
        * Normal PR interval is 0.16 seconds
        * If interval is greater than 0.20 seconds, first degree block is present
        * PR interval seldom increases above 0.35 to 0.45 seconds
    * Second degree
        * Intermittent
        * 2:1 or 3:1 ratios common
    * Third degree (complete block)
        * Total block through AV node or AV bundle
        * P-waves disassociated from QRST complexes
        * Ventricles escape
        * AV nodal rhythm ensues
    * Stokes-Adams Syndrome
        * Complete AV block comes and goes
        * Ventricles stop for 5-30 seconds
        * Patient faints due to poor cerebral blood flow
        * Ventricular escape with AV nodal or bundle rhythm
        * Ventricular pacemakers give
* Fibrillation
    * Prolonged or unusual conduction route, giving a circus movement
    * Also known as flutter
    * Little blood ends up flowing out of the heart due to inconsistent contraction
    * Caused by electrical shock or cardiac ischemia
    * Started via re-entrant phenomena
    * Ventricular fibrillation
        * Lethal
        * "Heart attack"
        * Need CPR to survive
        * Defibrillation makes the entire heart go into refractory period at same time
    * Atrial fibrillation
        * No P wave
        * Arrhythmia
        * Average heart rate is increased
        * QRST wave is normal
        * Generally not lethal as ventricle can still fill
        * Atrial fibrillation doesn't usually also mean ventricular fibrillation
        * Commonly caused by atrial enlargement from AV valve dysfunction
        * Efficiency of ventricular pumping decreased 20-30%
        * Irregular, fast heart rate due to irregular arrival of impulse to AV node
        * Treat with drugs that reduce excitability
        * Burn off bad conduction routes with a laser


#### Cardiac cycle

"Lub/Dub"

Make diagram

Other side of the heart is lower pressure but same shape and volume.

#### Control of heart rate

The Cardiac Output (CO) is the volume pumped by each ventricle in a minute, i.e. the heart rate times the stroke volume.

CO = HR &times; SV

SV = EDV - ESV.

E.g. resting: 70 bpm &times; 80 mL/beat = 5.6 L/min; Exercising: 173 bpm &times; 120 mL/beat = 21 L/min.

In theory the heart could beat as fast as 400 bpm, however the maximum rate of the SA node is only 230 bpm.

| Animal | CO (mL/min/kg) |
|:------ | --------------:|
| Fish   | 10             |
| Human  | 85             |
| Rat    | 200            |
| Duck   | 500            |

##### ANS

The sympathetic system controls the SA node, with &beta;1 receptors. The Parasympathetic system controls the SA node via muscaranic receptors. The SNS increases HR (trachycardia); the PSNS decreases HR (bradycardia).

The right thoracic branch of the SNS has mostly a chronotropic effect; the left has more of an inotropic. The right vagus nerve innevates the SA node to give a chronotropic effect; the left inneravates the AV node and some myocardial cells giving a prolonged PR interval and slight decreased inotropy (contractility).

The SNS causes a increased repolarisation of the SNS, hitting the threshold earlier; the PSNS causes hyperpolarisation and then and slower repolarisation.

When SNS or PSNS are stimulated or stop being stimulated you get sizable shitfs in heart rate&mdash;this is the "tonic" levels of ANS control of the heart. At reast the PSNS is dominant.

##### Hormonal control

Adrenaline and Noradrenaline cause increases in heart rate. Thyroxin causes increase in heart rate, while acetylcholine (Ach) causes decrease in HR.

##### Reflexes

* Bainbridge reflex (right and left atrial receptors)
    * Increase in atrial pressure
    * Prevents backup of veins, atria, and pulmonary circulation
    * Stretch in atria sends signals to increase heart rate and contractility
* Bezold-Jarish reflex (left ventricular receptors)
    * Causes decrease in heart rate
    * Role in pathologies, e.g. haemorrhage?
    * Otherwise function unknown

##### Other mechanisms

These include temperature, electrolytes, pH, gas tensions etc.

#### Stroke volume control

Mathematical rules:

* CO = HR &times; SV
* SV = EDV - ESV
* &uarr; EDV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO
* &darr; ESV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO

One way to control this is via the control of ventricular filling&mdash;that is, control of EDV (end diastolic volume)

This can be controled via:

* Venous return rate
    * &uarr;P<sub>veins</sub> &rArr; &uarr;VR &rArr; &uarr;EDV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO
* Filling time
    * (effect of changes in heart rate)
    * &uarr;HR &rArr; &darr;Filling time &rArr; &darr;EDV &rArr; &darr;SV &rArr; &darr;CO
    * Increase in heart rate increases CO becuase CO = HR &times; SV, but the increase in HR also has a negative effect on CO via decreaseing SV due to less filling time. The balance is generally in favour of increasing CO however.
* Intraventricular pressure
    * The pressure of the thorax and ventricle effects the &Delta;P for VR.
    * Internally, ventricular recoil immediately after systole causes negative P<sub>ventricle</sub> and rapid filling, like popping out of a pushed-in tennis ball.
    * Externally, changes in thoracic pressure with breathing changes pressure
        * Inspiration &rArr; &darr;P<sub>venous</sub> in thorax &amp; &darr;P<sub>ventricle</sub> &rArr; &uarr;&Delta;P between extrathoracic viens and thorax and ventricle &rArr; &uarr;VR &rArr; &uarr;EDV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO
        * Expiration is the reverse of inspiration, but the effect of inspiration dominates
* Atrial contractility
    * Forces extra blood into ventricle just before systole
    * Minor at rest (~20% of filling ventrcle) but contributes up to 40% of SV with maximal exercise
* Pericardial restraint
    * The tissue around the heart ensures that the heart doesn't take in too much blood

Another way is ESV control (control of contractility or inotropy)

* Internal control
    * The Frank-Sterling Law of the Heart: The force of contraction (SV) is directly proportional to the stretch of the cardiac muscle (EDV). **Always on the test**
        * Heterometric autoregulation
            * The effect of "preload" or EDV on stroke volume
            * As EDV increases, SV increases, until the heart is so far extended that the actin and myosin are too streatched to interact
            * Ensures that all blood entering the heart is pumped
        * Homeometric Autoregulation
            * Effect of "afterload" or aortic pressure
            * Normally, &uarr; Mean Arterial Pressure (MBP) &rArr; &uarr;ESV &rArr; &darr;SV &rArr; &darr;CO
            * But by compensation from homeometric autoregulation, &uarr;MBP &rArr; &uarr;inotropy &rArr; &darr;ESV (correction) &rArr; &uarr;SV back to normal
* External control
    * ANS control
        * SNS control is dominant, increasing inotropy
        * PSNS control is lesser, decreasing inotropy
    * &uarr;HR increases Calcium ions becuase there is not enough time for them to be re-taken up by SR, which increases inotropy
    * Certain hormones increase inotropy, e.g. adrenaline
    * In the heart the plasma calcium concentration is important because plasma calcium entering the cell triggers calcium release within it; not true in skeletal muscles
    * Acidosis and alkalosis both cause a decrease in inotropy
    * Pharmacalogical agents can increase or decrease SV depending on what they are
    * Heart failure has an effect here

### Vasculature

Flow = &Delta;P/R, which is analogous to Ohm's law (I = V/R).

* &Delta;P = P<sub>i</sub> - P<sub>o</sub>
    * Controlled by heart contraction
    * P<sub>i</sub> is "pressure in"
    * P<sub>o</sub> is "pressure out"
* R = 8L&eta;/&pi;r<sup>4</sup>
    * L is the length (largely constant)
    * &eta; is the coefficient of viscosity (related to hematocrit)
    * r is the radius (the largest factor on resistance)
* Conductance = 1/R

#### Arteries

Arteries are flow conduits: thick walled, high pressure. When the wall is damaged or otherwise thin, an aneurysm is the result. There is smooth muscle in the wall, though not with the same control as in veins. The "WindKessel Effect" creates an "elastic reservoir," as the artery increases pressure it expands, and then contracts, to preserve pressure.

The pulse pressure is calculated as the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure, i.e. PP = SP - DP. DP is the lowest pressure during a pulse, SP is the highest. Mean Blood Pressure (MBP) = CO &times; Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR), which can be derived from the flow equation (and will be **on the test**). MBP can be estimated as DP + &frac13;PP, as at rest diastole is &frac23; of the cardiac cycle. This relationship breaks down when exercising, however.

There are various abnormal pressure pulse contours. Atherosclerosis is the hardening of the arteries, which leads to reduced compliance. Aortic stenosis is when the valve diameter is small, which causes reduced blood flow through the valve. Patent ductus arteriosis is the back flow of blood into pulmonary artery (up to 50%),  which allows the DP to fall very low before next systole. Aortic regurgitation, which is when the aortic valve is faulty, allows DP to fall very low before next systole, even down to 0 mm Hg, and leading to no dichrotic notch.

Compliance is the ability to give and conform, and is equal to &Delta;V/&Delta;P &mdash; a completely rigid tube has no compliance.

#### Arterioles

Arterioles are resistance vessels: Small, variable diameter, with neural, hormonal, and local control of resistance via smooth muscle. The regulation of resistance can divert flow to specific tissues, or raise arterial pressure. Resistance is controlled through changing the diameter of the vessel.

Local control by tissues (myogenic and metabolic) act as "fail safes," ensuring constant flow with changes in blood pressure. Myogenic autoregulation is especially common in tissues that have a low level of metabolism at all times, like the mesenteries that hold the small intestine in place, to avoid getting killed by the ANS. Metabolic control comes from metabolites that relax smooth muscle and increase flow. "Active Hyperemia" comes from active tissue needing more blood. "Reactive Hyperemia" comes from blockages, where metabolites build up and need to be washed away.

Both parts of the ANS innervate aterioles. The most important part is &alpha; adrenergic fibres, which derive from the SNS, which cause vasoconstriction when stimulated and dilation when not. Only the brain and heart are not innervated by the SNS in this way, as they cannot afford to be shut down. There are also some &beta;2 SNS adrenergic fibres, which promote vasodiation and not constriction, particularly in skeletal muscle. Also dilating are some Ach-releasing SNS fibres, which seem to have a role in anticipating exercise.

PSNS control also exists, but is minor.

Adrenalin causes vasoconstriction, though in lower doses in skeletal muscle and liver it causes vasodilation.

#### Capillaries

Capillaries are exchange vessels: Small diameter, single endothelial cell thick, and having pores (or "fenestrations"). The pores allow protein movement across endothelium. Liver capillaries are the most leaky, also spleen and pituitary; intestine and kidney have medium leakiness; muscle, skin, heart, lung, brain least leaky.

Capillary flow is controlled via pre-capillary sphincters, which are locally controlled as have no smooth muscle. Because of the large cross-sectional area there is low resistance in capillaries, even though they are thin. The low flow velocity allows time for exchange to occur.

The fluids in blood filters out of capillaries at the arteriola end, and reabsorbed at venous end, determined via sterling forces. Processes such as vasoconstriction alter the balance, in that case to absorb more than filter out.

The flow in capillaries is not constant, and flow can go backwards etc.

#### Veins

Veins are capacitance vessels: Large diametre, low resistance, thin walled (low pressure), highly distensible. Valves ensure flow back to heart.

* &uarr;Pvein &rArr; &uarr;VR &rArr; &uarr;EDV &rArr; &uarr;CO
* &uarr;volume &rArr; small &uarr;Pvein (acts as a blood reservour)
* &uarr;venoconstriction &rArr; &darr;capacitance &rArr; &darr;pooling &rArr; Pv


### Lymphatic system

To avoid loss of fluids from increasingly high pressure vascular system, the oncotic pressure increased and the lymphatic system evolved. Some fish seem to have a lymphatic system (e.g. zebrafish) but not clear if all fish.

The lymphatic system has open-ended vessels and is highly permeable, but has valves and muscle pumps. It has a slow flow and drains back into circulation.

The system also transports fat from GI tract to blood, protects from infection at lympth nodes, and filters returned material. Something like 4.3 L/day is returned to circulation via the lymphatic system. Blockage of lymphatic system via nematodes causes elephantisis.

### Cardiovascular regulation

#### Blood pressure control by the CVC

Arterial blood pressure is sensed via the arterial baroreceptor feedback reflex from carotid sinus and aortic arch. It is effected via SNS and PSNS to heart SA node and myocardium, SNS to arterioles and veins, and SNS to adrenal medulla gland.

The regulatory centre is the CVC (cardiovascular system), which receives sensorary input and directs output via the ANS to the heart and other organs. This can be overridden by local mechanisms to prevent cell death.

**Missing stuff**

### The lungs

#### Functions

Gas exchange, but also:

* Filters clots and bubbles from the circulation
* Metabolises compounds
* Blood reservoir
* Excretes water and volatile acids


#### Pulmonary anatomy

The alveoli are the functional unit of the cell. Conducting region of lungs have no avleoli (dead space). The trachea is supported by cartelage rings.

Trachea &rarr; bronchii &rarr; bronchioles &rarr; alveolar ducts.

Alveoli are little bubbles of tissue, supported by surficant. The bubbles mean huge surface area. There is several thousand times more surface area of the lungs than if they were spheres of the same size. The amount of oxygen taken up is limited by the amount of blood pumped, not the rate of diffusion, because the walls are so thin.

#### Airflow mechanics

Inspiration (breathing in) is caused by the contraction of the diaphram beneath the lungs. Expiration is primarily just the relaxtion, however the ribcage can be forced downwards to force air outwards.

### GI tract

## Pharmacology

Curare is a poison used for hunting in the Amazon&mdash;why can you still eat the meat?

Sample brought back to Britian in 1804 by Charles Waterton. In 1811 it was shown that, if lungs pumped with bellows, rabbits could survive to recover.

## Endocrinology

The endocrine system is a colleciton of glands and organs, which regulates them to meet the growth and reproductive needs of the organism, and respond to fluctuations within the internal organism e.g. stress. Endocrine is more long-acting than the nervous system. The endocrine system acts using hormones in the bloodstream.

One glad can secrete many hormones, more rarely one hormone can be secreted by many glands.

Autocrine signalling is a cell affecting itself via its own secreted hormones. Paracrine signalling is a cell signalling other nearby cells through the interstitial fluid. The endocrine system travels through the blood.

### Nervous system vs endocrine system

| Nervous system | Endocrine |
|:---------------|:----------|
| Neurotransmitters released in response to nerve impulses | Hormones delivered by the blood to tissues throughout the body |
| Muscle, glands, other neurones | Virtually all body cells |
| Muscular contraction or glandular secretion | Changes in metabolic activities |
| Typically acts within miliseconds | Seconds to hours or days |
| Generally briefer duration | Generally longer |

### Endocrine vs Exocrine

The endocrine system is ductless, secreting into the intercellular space (local action) and from there to the bloodstream. The exocrine system extretes fluids through ducts to cavities and body surfaces

### Major endocrine glands

* Pineal
    * Seasonality; not going to talk about
* Hypothalamus
* Pituitary gland
* Thyroid
* Parathyroid
* Adrenal
* Pancreas
* Ovaries
* Testes
* Placenta

### Other organs that excrete hormones

* Kidney
    * Remin
    * 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalfierol
    * Erthropoithin
* Heart
    * Atrial natriuretic peptide
* Stomach
    * Gastrin
* Small intestine
    * Secretin
    * Cholecrystokinin
* Adipocytes
    * Leptin

### Hormones

> A hormone is a signalling molecule produced by glands in multicellular organisms that is transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour

No nucleotide or polysaccharide hormones are known; all known hormones are proteins/polypeptides, steroids, and amine hormones (derivatives of tyrosine).
