Description:

> The major emphasis in this paper will be the correlation of molecular and cellular mechanisms with physiological functions in humans and other mammalian species. An integrative approach will be adopted in studying the roles of the central and peripheral nervous system and various organ systems in relation to the metabolic, hormonal and homeostatic mechanisms involved in circulation, respiration, and digestion. Neurophysiology and renal excretion will be covered at 300-level in BMSC 335. The modulation of physiological function will be explored in a series of pharmacology lectures. These will focus on the mediation of such effects at the molecular level.

## Physiology

The first part, with Dr Miller, starting July 11.

### The Autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls bodily processes that are not consciously controlled, e.g. breathing, digestion etc. The ANS is divided into the Sympathetic (SNS) and Parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous systems, which broadly act as opposites.

Controls e.g.

* Heart rate
* Blood pressure
* Intestinal mobility
* Perspiration

You can teach yourself to control _some_ of the autonomic functions, but not all of them.

#### Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)

* "Excitable", like when being chased or scared
* Ganglia lie near spinal cord
* Accelerates
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Brake for
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Drugs that block the effect of noradrenalin and adrenalin 
    * Synthesis and storage
	* Reserpine
    * Release from the nerve terminal
	* Guanethidine
    * Alpha blockers
        * Phentolamine
	* Phenoxybenzamine
    * Beta blockers
	* beta<sub>1</sub> and beta<sub>2</sub>: propranolol
	* beta<sub>1</sub> only: metoprolol
	* beta<sub>2</sub> only: albuterol
    * Ganglionic blockers
	* Hexamethonium
	* Suxamethonium

#### Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS)

* Ganglia lie in/near effector organ
* Accelerates
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Brake for
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Parasympathomimetic drugs (mimic effect of stimulated PSNS
    * Nicotine (activates nicotine receptors)
    * Pilocarpine and methacholine
	* Activate muscuranic receptors
	* Cause e.g. profuse sweating
* Cholinesterase inhibitors
    * Neostigmine
    * Physostigmine (eserine)
    * Potentiate the effect of acetylcholine
* Antimuscarinic drugs
    * Atropine (belladonna)
    * Scopolamine
    * Block the effect of acetylocolin on effector cells
    * Cause pupillary dilation

### Cardiovascular system

The cardiovascular system is made of two circuits: systemic and pulmonary

The left heart pumps blood to all the tissues&mdash;systemic system&mdash;and is therefore much more muscular. The right heart is floppier, because it only has to pump to the heart.

In the systemic system the capillaries are in parallel, not in series. The portal circuits allow blood to go from the gut to the liver.

The systemic system has a much higher pressure than the pulmonary system. Further, the arteries of the systemic system are higher pressure than the veins. Arteries are more muscular, have a redder colour, and pulse more than veins.

#### Heart anatomy

Four chambers: Left and right ventricles and atrium. Right atrium takes blood from veins of systemic system,[^venacava] and right ventricle pumps into pulmonary artery. The left atrium takes oxygenated blood from pulmonary veins[^pluveins] and the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta and thus systemic arteries. Valves control flow between atria and ventricles, regulated by pressure. When the pressure in the ventricle is lower than the pressure in the atrium, AV valves are opened. When the pressure in the aorta is lower than the pressure in the ventricle, the aortic valves are opened. The _chordae tendineae_, pulled by the papillary muscles, move the AV valve.

[^venacava]: Specifically, the superior and inferior _vena cava_. The superior comes from above, inferior below.

[^pluveins]: There are multiple pulmonary veins which drain directly into the left ventricle.

#### Heart rate

The hummingbird's heart beats, when exercising, at 1200 bpm, or 20 bps. As a general rule, larger animals have slower heartbeats. Whales do 10-15 bpm; humans around 70 bpm. It is theorised that the pacemaker in the SA node can beat 10<sup>9</sup> times in a lifetime, but this is too few for an average lifespan.

Heart cells in culture beat independently and spontaneously, but when multiple cells are put together they beat synchronously. The fastest cell (highest bpm) acts as a pacemaker. In the heart the SA node has the fastest automaticity, so is the pacemaker. The AV node is the second fastest, so when there are problems with the SA node it takes over&mdash;however, this is slower and less regular. In disease, the ectopic focus can take over as pacemaker.

In some animals&mdash;crustaceans, insects, annelids&mdash;the heart beat is neurogenic, and so removing the heart will cause it to cease to beat. Vertebrate, tunicates, and molluscs have myogenic heart beats. A human heart would not beat for very long, however, because it would run out of oxygen very quickly; a frog heart would beat for much longer.

Internodal atrial pathways radiate out from the SA node and into the atria. One of these reaches the AV node in the centre of the heart; this is the only way for current to cross a "non-conductile" fibrous tissue ring that separates the atria and ventricles. Right and left bundle branches come down from the AV node to the base of the heart, then radiate out from below into the ventricles through the Purkinje fibres. This allows the atria and the ventricles to contract one after the other.

#### Cardiac action potentials

An individual heart muscle fibre cell first spikes, plateaus, and then reverts to normal. The refractory period is between 200 and 250 msec. The tension follows a different graph, trailing the action potential.

Slow response fibres.....
