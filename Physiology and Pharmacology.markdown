Description:

> The major emphasis in this paper will be the correlation of molecular and cellular mechanisms with physiological functions in humans and other mammalian species. An integrative approach will be adopted in studying the roles of the central and peripheral nervous system and various organ systems in relation to the metabolic, hormonal and homeostatic mechanisms involved in circulation, respiration, and digestion. Neurophysiology and renal excretion will be covered at 300-level in BMSC 335. The modulation of physiological function will be explored in a series of pharmacology lectures. These will focus on the mediation of such effects at the molecular level.

## Physiology

The first part, with Dr Miller, starting July 11.

### The Autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls bodily processes that are not consciously controlled, e.g. breathing, digestion etc. The ANS is divided into the Sympathetic (SNS) and Parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous systems, which broadly act as opposites.

Controls e.g.

* Heart rate
* Blood pressure
* Intestinal mobility
* Perspiration

#### Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)

* Ganglia lie near spinal cord
* Accelerates
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Brake for
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Drugs that block the effect of noradrenalin and adrenalin 
    * Synthesis and storage
	* Reserpine
    * Release from the nerve terminal
	* Guanethidine
    * Alpha blockers
        * Phentolamine
	* Phenoxybenzamine
    * Beta blockers
	* beta<sub>1</sub> and beta<sub>2</sub>: propranolol
	* beta<sub>1</sub> only: metoprolol
	* beta<sub>2</sub> only: albuterol
    * Ganglionic blockers
	* Hexamethonium
	* Suxamethonium

#### Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS)

* Ganglia lie in/near effector organ
* Accelerates
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Brake for
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Parasympathomimetic drugs (mimic effect of stimulated PSNS
    * Nicotine (activates nicotine receptors)
    * Pilocarpine and methacholine
	* Activate muscuranic receptors
	* Cause e.g. profuse sweating
* Cholinesterase inhibitors
    * Neostigmine
    * Physostigmine (eserine)
    * Potentiate the effect of acetylcholine
* Antimuscarinic drugs
    * Atropine (belladonna)
    * Scopolamine
    * Block the effect of acetylocolin on effector cells
    * Cause pupillary dilation

### Cardiovascular system

The cardiovascular system is made of two circuits: systemic and pulmonary
