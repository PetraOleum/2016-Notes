Description:

> The major emphasis in this paper will be the correlation of molecular and cellular mechanisms with physiological functions in humans and other mammalian species. An integrative approach will be adopted in studying the roles of the central and peripheral nervous system and various organ systems in relation to the metabolic, hormonal and homeostatic mechanisms involved in circulation, respiration, and digestion. Neurophysiology and renal excretion will be covered at 300-level in BMSC 335. The modulation of physiological function will be explored in a series of pharmacology lectures. These will focus on the mediation of such effects at the molecular level.

## Physiology

The first part, with Dr Miller, starting July 11.

### The Autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls bodily processes that are not consciously controlled, e.g. breathing, digestion etc. The ANS is divided into the Sympathetic (SNS) and Parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous systems, which broadly act as opposites.

Controls e.g.

* Heart rate
* Blood pressure
* Intestinal mobility
* Perspiration

You can teach yourself to control _some_ of the autonomic functions, but not all of them.

#### Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)

* "Excitable", like when being chased or scared
* Ganglia lie near spinal cord
* Accelerates
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Brake for
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Drugs that block the effect of noradrenalin and adrenalin 
    * Synthesis and storage
        * Reserpine
    * Release from the nerve terminal
        * Guanethidine
    * Alpha blockers
        * Phentolamine
        * Phenoxybenzamine
    * Beta blockers
        * beta<sub>1</sub> and beta<sub>2</sub>: propranolol
        * beta<sub>1</sub> only: metoprolol
        * beta<sub>2</sub> only: albuterol
    * Ganglionic blockers
        * Hexamethonium
        * Suxamethonium

#### Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS)

* Ganglia lie in/near effector organ
* Accelerates
    * Gastrointestinal tract
* Brake for
    * Cardiovascular system
    * Respiratory system
* Parasympathomimetic drugs (mimic effect of stimulated PSNS
    * Nicotine (activates nicotine receptors)
    * Pilocarpine and methacholine
        * Activate muscuranic receptors
        * Cause e.g. profuse sweating
* Cholinesterase inhibitors
    * Neostigmine
    * Physostigmine (eserine)
    * Potentiate the effect of acetylcholine
* Antimuscarinic drugs
    * Atropine (belladonna)
    * Scopolamine
    * Block the effect of acetylocolin on effector cells
    * Cause pupillary dilation

### Cardiovascular system

The cardiovascular system is made of two circuits: systemic and pulmonary

The left heart pumps blood to all the tissues&mdash;systemic system&mdash;and is therefore much more muscular. The right heart is floppier, because it only has to pump to the heart.

In the systemic system the capillaries are in parallel, not in series. The portal circuits allow blood to go from the gut to the liver.

The systemic system has a much higher pressure than the pulmonary system. Further, the arteries of the systemic system are higher pressure than the veins. Arteries are more muscular, have a redder colour, and pulse more than veins.

#### Heart anatomy

Four chambers: Left and right ventricles and atrium. Right atrium takes blood from veins of systemic system,[^venacava] and right ventricle pumps into pulmonary artery. The left atrium takes oxygenated blood from pulmonary veins[^pluveins] and the left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta and thus systemic arteries. Valves control flow between atria and ventricles, regulated by pressure. When the pressure in the ventricle is lower than the pressure in the atrium, AV valves are opened. When the pressure in the aorta is lower than the pressure in the ventricle, the aortic valves are opened. The _chordae tendineae_, pulled by the papillary muscles, move the AV valve.

[^venacava]: Specifically, the superior and inferior _vena cava_. The superior comes from above, inferior below.

[^pluveins]: There are multiple pulmonary veins which drain directly into the left ventricle.

#### Heart rate

The hummingbird's heart beats, when exercising, at 1200 bpm, or 20 bps. As a general rule, larger animals have slower heartbeats. Whales do 10-15 bpm; humans around 70 bpm. It is theorised that the pacemaker in the SA node can beat 10<sup>9</sup> times in a lifetime, but this is too few for an average lifespan.

Heart cells in culture beat independently and spontaneously, but when multiple cells are put together they beat synchronously. The fastest cell (highest bpm) acts as a pacemaker. In the heart the SA node has the fastest automaticity, so is the pacemaker. The AV node is the second fastest, so when there are problems with the SA node it takes over&mdash;however, this is slower and less regular. In disease, the ectopic focus can take over as pacemaker.

In some animals&mdash;crustaceans, insects, annelids&mdash;the heart beat is neurogenic, and so removing the heart will cause it to cease to beat. Vertebrate, tunicates, and molluscs have myogenic heart beats. A human heart would not beat for very long, however, because it would run out of oxygen very quickly; a frog heart would beat for much longer.

Internodal atrial pathways radiate out from the SA node and into the atria. One of these reaches the AV node in the centre of the heart; this is the only way for current to cross a "non-conductile" fibrous tissue ring that separates the atria and ventricles. Right and left bundle branches come down from the AV node to the base of the heart, then radiate out from below into the ventricles through the Purkinje fibres. This allows the atria and the ventricles to contract one after the other.

#### Cardiac action potentials

An individual heart fast response fibre cell first spikes, plateaus, and then reverts to normal. The refractory period is between 200 and 250 msec. The tension follows a different graph, trailing the action potential.

Slow response fibres have a different pattern, with spontaneous depolarisations due to an Na<sup>2+</sup> leak.

#### Cardiac electrical pathologies

A normal ECG has P, QRS, and T waves. The T wave is a repolarisation wave; while another repolarisation wave for the atria is concealed under the QRS wave.

A ECG with "bipolar leads" means that the ECG is recorded from two electrodes on the body.

* Lead I: left arm + right arm
* Lead II: left leg + right arm
* Lead III: left leg + leg arm

Third lead is earth (ground).

The Mean Electrical Axis is the mean vector through the partially depolarised heart. The average mean electrical axis is 59&deg; down, but the normal range is +110&deg; to -30&deg;. This will be calculated in lab 3, human circulation. Only two leads are needed to calculate the vector, however if you use all three you can work out how consistent your measurements are.

The normal off-balance of the axis is due to the normal asymmetry of the heart, and so this can be used to diagnose diseases related to non-normal asymmetry. For example, hypertrophy of the left ventricle can be seen in a large left shift of the axis. Hypertrophy can be caused by the heart having to work a lot harder, whether due to exercise or through a variety of underlying pathologies.

Left axis shift can also be called by a left bundle branch block, which slows the passage of current to the left and makes it pulse later.

Right axis shift can be caused by hypertrophy of the right ventricle, pulmonary valve stenosis, or interventricle septal defect.

#### Cardiac Arrhythmias

This can be caused by:

* Abnormal rhythmity of the pacemaker
* Shift of pacemaker from sinoatrial node
* Blocks at different points in the transmission of the cardiac impulse
* Abnormal pathways of the transmission in the heart
* Spontaneous generation of abnormal impulses (ectopic beats) from any parts of the heart

Normal arrhythmias:

* Bradycardia
    * A slow heart rate usually less than 60 bpm
    * Present in athletes who have a large stroke volume
    * Can be caused by vagal stimulation
* Tachycardia
    * Fast heart rate, usually greater than 100 bpm
    * Caused by:
        * Increased body temperature
        * Sympathetic stimulation (e.g. loss of blood or reflex stimulation of the heart)
        * Emotion
        * Toxic conditions of the heart
        * Exercise
    * E.g. Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

Abnormal arrhythmias:

* Atrial Paroxysmal Tachycardia
    * "Paroxysmal" = A series of rapid heart beats that suddenly start and then suddenly stop
    * Can be stopped with a vagal reflex or quinidine or procainimide
    * P waves is inverted if origin is near AV node
    * Occurs by re-entrant pathways
* Ventricular Paroxysmal Tachycardia
    * Usually does not occur unless there has been ischemic damage
    * Quinidine increases refractory period of cardiac muscle and can eliminate the problem
* Extra beats (ectopic foci)
    * Often near nodal tissue
    * Premature contractions
    * Caused by
        * Local areas of ischemia
        * Calcified plaques
        * Toxic irritation of AV node, Purkinje system, or myocardium by drugs (nicotine, caffeine)
* SA block
    * Rare
    * Impulses from the SA node are blocked
    * Causes cessation of p waves
    * New pacemaker&mdash;usually AV node (next fastest rate)
* AV block
    * May be due to fibrosis of conductile tissue
    * Impulses through AV node and bundle are slowed or blocked due to
        * Ischemia of AV nodal or AV bundle fibres (can be caused by coronary ischemia)
        * Compression of AV bundle (by scar tissue or calcified tissue)
        * AV nodal or AV bundle inflammation
        * Excessive vagal stimulation
    * First degree heart block
        * Prolonged PR interval
        * Normal PR interval is 0.16 seconds
        * If interval is greater than 0.20 seconds, first degree block is present
        * PR interval seldom increases above 0.35 to 0.45 seconds
    * Second degree
        * Intermittent
        * 2:1 or 3:1 ratios common
    * Third degree (complete block)
        * Total block through AV node or AV bundle
        * P-waves disassociated from QRST complexes
        * Ventricles escape
        * AV nodal rhythm ensues
    * Stokes-Adams Syndrome
        * Complete AV block comes and goes
        * Ventricles stop for 5-30 seconds
        * Patient faints due to poor cerebral blood flow
        * Ventricular escape with AV nodal or bundle rhythm
        * Ventricular pacemakers give
* Fibrillation
    * Prolonged or unusual conduction route, giving a circus movement
    * Also known as flutter
    * Little blood ends up flowing out of the heart due to inconsistent contraction
    * Caused by electrical shock or cardiac ischemia
    * Started via re-entrant phenomena
    * Ventricular fibrillation
        * Lethal
        * "Heart attack"
        * Need CPR to survive
        * Defibrillation makes the entire heart go into refractory period at same time
    * Atrial fibrillation
        * No P wave
        * Arrhythmia
        * Average heart rate is increased
        * QRST wave is normal
        * Generally not lethal as ventricle can still fill
        * Atrial fibrillation doesn't usually also mean ventricular fibrillation
        * Commonly caused by atrial enlargement from AV valve dysfunction
        * Efficiency of ventricular pumping decreased 20-30%
        * Irregular, fast heart rate due to irregular arrival of impulse to AV node
        * Treat with drugs that reduce excitability
        * Burn off bad conduction routes with a laser


#### Cardiac cycle

"Lub/Dub"

Make diagram

Other side of the heart is lower pressure but same shape and volume.

#### Control of heart rate

The Cardiac Output (CO) is the volume pumped by each ventricle in a minute, i.e. the heart rate times the stroke volume.

CO = HR &times; SV

SV = EDV - ESV.

E.g. resting: 70 bpm &times; 80 mL/beat = 5.6 L/min; Exercising: 173 bpm &times; 120 mL/beat = 21 L/min.

In theory the heart could beat as fast as 400 bpm, however the maximum rate of the SA node is only 230 bpm.

| Animal | CO (mL/min/kg) |
|:------ | --------------:|
| Fish   | 10             |
| Human  | 85             |
| Rat    | 200            |
| Duck   | 500            |

##### ANS

The sympathetic system controls the SA node, with &beta;1 receptors. The Parasympathetic system controls the SA node via muscaranic receptors. The SNS increases HR (trachycardia); the PSNS decreases HR (bradycardia).

The right thoracic branch of the SNS has mostly a chronotropic effect; the left has more of an inotropic. The right vagus nerve innevates the SA node to give a chronotropic effect; the left inneravates the AV node and some myocardial cells giving a prolonged PR interval and slight decreased inotropy (contractility).

The SNS causes a increased repolarisation of the SNS, hitting the threshold earlier; the PSNS causes hyperpolarisation and then and slower repolarisation.

When SNS or PSNS are stimulated or stop being stimulated you get sizable shitfs in heart rate&mdash;this is the "tonic" levels of ANS control of the heart. At reast the PSNS is dominant.

##### Hormonal control

Adrenaline and Noradrenaline cause increases in heart rate. Thyroxin causes increase in heart rate, while acetylcholine (Ach) causes decrease in HR.

##### Reflexes

* Bainbridge reflex (right and left atrial receptors)
    * Increase in atrial pressure
    * Prevents backup of veins, atria, and pulmonary circulation
    * Stretch in atria sends signals to increase heart rate and contractility
* Bezold-Jarish reflex (left ventricular receptors)
    * Causes decrease in heart rate
    * Role in pathologies, e.g. haemorrhage?
    * Otherwise function unknown

##### Other mechanisms

These include temperature, electrolytes, pH, gas tensions etc.

#### Stroke volume control

Mathematical rules:

* CO = HR &times; SV
* SV = EDV - ESV
* &uarr; EDV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO
* &darr; ESV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO

One way to control this is via the control of ventricular filling&mdash;that is, control of EDV (end diastolic volume)

This can be controled via:

* Venous return rate
    * &uarr;Pveins &rArr; &uarr;VR &rArr; &uarr;EDV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO
* Filling time
    * (effect of changes in heart rate)
    * &uarr;HR &rArr; &darr;Filling time &rArr; &darr;EDV &rArr; &darr;SV &rArr; &darr;CO
    * Increase in heart rate increases CO becuase CO = HR &times; SV, but the increase in HR also has a negative effect on CO via decreaseing SV due to less filling time. The balance is generally in favour of increasing CO however.
* Intraventricular pressure
    * The pressure of the thorax and ventricle effects the &Delta;P for VR.
    * Internally, ventricular recoil immediately after systole causes negative Pventricle and rapid filling, like popping out of a pushed-in tennis ball.
    * Externally, changes in thoracic pressure with breathing changes pressure
        * Inspiration &rArr; &darr;Pvenous in thorax &amp; &darr;Pventricle &rArr; &uarr;&Delta;P between extrathoracic viens and thorax and ventricle &rArr; &uarr;VR &rArr; &uarr;EDV &rArr; &uarr;SV &rArr; &uarr;CO
        * Expiration is the reverse of inspiration, but the effect of inspiration dominates
* Atrial contractility
    * Forces extra blood into ventricle just before systole
    * Minor at rest (~20% of filling ventrcle) but contributes up to 40% of SV with maximal exercise
* Pericardial restraint
    * The tissue around the heart ensures that the heart doesn't take in too much blood

Another way is ESV control (control of contractility or inotropy)

* Internal control
    * The Frank-Sterling Law of the Heart: The force of contraction (SV) is directly proportional to the stretch of the cardiac muscle (EDV)
        * Heterometric autoregulation
            * The effect of "preload" or EDV on stroke volume
            * As EDV increases, SV increases, until the heart is so far extended that the actin and myosin are too streatched to interact
            * Ensures that all blood entering the heart is pumped
        * Homeometric Autoregulation
            * Effect of "afterload" or aortic pressure
            * Normally, &uarr; Mean Arterial Pressure (MBP) &rArr; &uarr;ESV &rArr; &darr;SV &rArr; &darr;CO
            * But by compensation from homeometric autoregulation, &uarr;MBP &rArr; &uarr;inotropy &rArr; &darr;ESV (correction) &rArr; &uarr;SV back to normal
* External control
    * ANS control
        * SNS control is dominant, increasing inotropy
        * PSNS control is lesser, decreasing inotropy
    * &uarr;HR increases Calcium ions becuase there is not enough time for them to be re-taken up by SR, which increases inotropy
    * Certain hormones increase inotropy, e.g. adrenaline
    * In the heart the plasma calcium concentration is important because plasma calcium entering the cell triggers calcium release within it; not true in skeletal muscles
    * Acidosis and alkalosis both cause a decrease in inotropy
    * Pharmacalogical agents can increase or decrease SV depending on what they are
    * Heart failure has an effect here
