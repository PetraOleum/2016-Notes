#Vic 2016 notes

Git repo of my 2016 class notes:

* Advanced Genetics
* Statistics 2a
* Computability and Complexity

Repo includes makefile to produce ebooks, but not several pictures included within (e.g. cover images). These documents are in a purpetually unfinished state, intended to only be useful for me. If you're here because some online search for plagiarism on my work pinged this repo of my notes, such is the modern world. If you're not sure if this is the same person as the one whose work you're marking, _ask_.
